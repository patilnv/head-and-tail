#HEAD AND TAIL created by Nitesh Patil
This is linux Head and Tail command implementation in C.
# Features
I have included the following features of Head and Tail in my project
- Prints n number of first lines
- Prints n number last lines
- If filename is not specified for runnng program get meg as file is empty.

## Usage

```
head filename number 
```
tail filename number

## Example

./head filename.txt  6
./tail filename.txt  6

#### filename.txt
```
A text stream consists of 
a sequence of lines , 
each line ends with 
newline character. 
If the system does not 
operate that way,the library 
does whatever is necessary to 
make it appear as if it does.
